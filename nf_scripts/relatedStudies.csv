131,99,3D Models of Cutaneous Neurofibromas,syn11374354,syn11601495,Active,Under Embargo,Alice Soragni,NTAP,"Given the absence of therapeutic options and the heterogeneous nature of cutaneous neurofibromas (cNF), a physiological system that supports the growth of cNF tumor cells is required for drug screening efforts. We aim to adapt our optimized high-throughput 3D ring approach to develop a novel preclinical cNF model.  My laboratory has developed a robust high-throughput system to establish tumor organoids using a specific geometry to minimize sample handling and cell seeding density. By seeding cells in Matrigel in a mini-ring format we are able to routinely generate organoids from cell lines and primary samples in a format suitable for automation and high-throughput drug screenings. The approach does not necessitate of a priori cell expansion and allows to pinpoint drug sensitivities in within 5-6 days, hence avoiding most of the issues that arise from sample senescence and/or accumulation of genetic changes that can occur with prolonged time in culture. Our method is particularly suited to sustain growth of clinically relevant heterogeneous primary samples, both malignant as well as benign such as Schwann cells or fibroblasts. A single clinical sample can provide sufficient material to screen hundreds of drugs and identify individual drug susceptibilities. Here we aim to extend our proven method to cNF specimens to establish a reliable pre-clinical model. We will use primary samples obtained from NF1 patients and establish cNF organoids to elucidate disease biology and enable therapeutic testing. We anticipate collecting n=10 samples from adult NF1 patients through established collaborations with the UCLA NF clinic. We will characterize the tissues by histopathology and next generation sequencing (NGS) and determine whether the cNF 3D models recapitulate all the major features of the tumor of origin. While beyond the scope of the current project, the cNF models developed and validated here may be used in the future to perform automated high throughput 3D drug screenings to identify possible new therapeutic options for NF1 patients.",https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn11374354/wiki/488832,"University of California, Los Angeles",Neurofibromatosis 1,Cutaneous Neurofibroma,,,syn11374354,Accessing the data from this study requires a Synapse account.,,"syn8016635, syn11374333"

134,99,A Robust Plexiform Neurofibroma Model for Preclinical Drug Screening,syn8016635,syn12582871,Completed,Under Embargo,Lu Le,NTAP,"We utilized a genetically engineered mouse model as a tool to identify the cell of origin for plexiform neurofibroma. Using genetic labeling for cell-lineage tracing, we showed that the embryonic GAP43+PLP+ Schwann cell precursors originate from dorsal spinal nerve roots are the cells of origin for plexiform neurofibromas. Our studies point to the importance of stem cells and their immediate progenitors in the initiation of tumors, consistent with the notion that these neoplasms originate in a subset of primitive precursors and that most cells in an organ do not generate tumors. The identity of the tumor cell of origin and facility for isolation and expansion of these DRG/nerve root neurosphere cells (DNSCs), which contain the embryonic GAP43+PLP+ Schwann cell precursors, allow us to reconstruct all the biological steps from the original cells to tumor stage to delineate mechanism of neurofibromagenesis. Most importantly, the ability to isolate embryonic PLP+ GAP43+ cells for ex vivo expansion and Nf1 ablation to generate classic sciatic plexiform neurofibromas provides a reliable and robust non-germline neurofibroma model for in vivo drug screening with a quantifiable and reproducible outcome measure (via bioluminescent scan) to select lead compounds for clinical assessment. In this application, we propose to establish the utility of this non-germline plexiform neurofibroma (pNF) model as a rapid preclinical therapeutic drug screening tool to identify effective therapies for pNF. To achieve this goal, we will first explore the possibility of long term storage of DNSCs to maintain their tumorigenic potential for reliable and rapid plexiform neurofibromagenesis. Next, we will develop it into a robust plexiform neurofibroma model for preclinical drug screening by testing therapeutic effects of different pharmacological interventions.",https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn8016635/wiki/411638,University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center,Neurofibromatosis 1,Plexiform Neurofibroma,,,syn8016635,The data from this study is currently under embargo.

135,99,Acceptance and Commitment Therapy in NF1,syn4939896,syn15666830,Active,None,Staci Martin,NTAP,"NF1-related pain is often not well-controlled with medication and many of the medications cause significant side effects. To our knowledge, only one prior study (by our group) has examined the effectiveness of a psychological intervention for chronic pain in adolescents and young adults (AYA) with NF1 and PNs. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is a type of therapy that focuses on encouraging individuals to engage in more adaptive ways of coping with pain. The goal of ACT is not to eliminate the person's pain, but to optimize the person's functioning despite their pain. This study is examining the impact of an 8-week ACT intervention on pain interference and other variables among AYA ages 16-34 years with NF1, one or more PNs, and chronic pain. We also are exploring the role of heart rate variability (HRV), which is a physiological marker of pain, in this population. The goal of this project is to establish ACT's effectiveness as a psychological intervention tool targeting chronic pain in patients with NF1/PN, in order to improve daily functioning and pain interference. Our primary goal is to compare changes in pain interference scores from pre- to post- intervention between the ACT group and the waitlist (WL) group. Secondary aims include examining baseline to post-treatment changes in quality of life, pain severity, depression, pain-related anxiety, and HRV, assessed by electrocardiogram (ECG); comparing the ACT and WL groups on pre-post changes in quality of life, pain intensity, depression, pain-related anxiety, and HRV; and examining the relationships of HRV with pain and psychosocial variables.",https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn4939896/wiki/235904,National Institutes of Health,Neurofibromatosis 1,Plexiform Neurofibroma,,,syn4939896,,,syn4939912

Each tumor that is deconstructed will be a milestone along the way to reaching that goal. We anticipate that at least 8 tumors will need to be deconstructed to take account of the high degree of heterogeneity in the these tumors. Approximately 10,000 cells from each sample will be subject to scRNA-Seq, with the rest used for development of primary cNF cells and fibroblasts for use in Aim Two. The second aim has the goal of development of pathomimetic avatars of NF1 cNFs that will be useful for therapeutic testing.

Hence, creating a cell culture initiative was an early priority. While current animal models can faithfully mimic some aspects of pNF (tumor histology, imaging characteristics, natural history), they are based on relatively narrow genetically engineered platforms and are not fully representative of human NF1 diversity. Moreover, the tumors in these models are slow growing (requiring 9-12 months for a single compound efficacy study) and costly. Hence, there is a need for in vivo models that allow more rapid drug screening (particularly when considering possible combinatorial therapies) and a need for in vitro models that allow more facile manipulation of the NF1 gene in order to understand the molecular genomics influencing tumor behavior.

Extensive analysis has shown that from a genetic and genomic perspective, there is no additional recurrent genetic alteration besides the NF1 inactivation involved in cNFs. Despite its simple genetic etiology, the contribution of the interactions among cells composing cNFs need to be investigated to better understand their role in cNF formation and their potential influence on treatment response. In this work, we propose to use co-cultures of cNF-derived primary SCs and FBs to identify expression signatures in cNFs that are specifically due to SC-FB heterotypic interactions. For this purpose we will compare RNA-Seq data from cNFs, their single cell primary cultures and co-cultures of SCs and FBs. Furthermore, we will identify the genetic variation present in gene coding regions of neurofibroma donors. Since SCs and FBs used in co-cultures will belong to different individuals, we estimate to dissect about 75% of the expression signature due to SC-FB interactions by assigning each differently expressed gene to a specific cell type, according to their genetic variation. Signaling pathways represented by expression signatures will be analyzed and their disruption tested functionally.

While caused by loss of NF1 protein function in Schwannian lineage cells, studies in mouse plexiform neurofibroma models have revealed a critical role for non-neoplastic stromal cells (fibroblasts, mast cells, and macrophages) in tumor formation, maintenance, and continued growth. In this regard, inhibition of stromal cell (mast cells, macrophages) function in preclinical genetically-engineered mice resulted in attenuated plexiform neurofibroma growth. In addition to fibroblasts, mast cells, and macrophages, the NF1-deficient Schwann cells in cNFs often grow in proximity to terminal nerve endings. The intimate relationship between neurons and Schwann cells during normal peripheral nervous system development and function raises the intriguing possibility that neurons are important drivers of cNF growth. This notion is supported by recent studies in which the proliferation of myelinating cells in the central nervous system (oligodendrocytes) is regulated by neuronal production of a novel growth factor (neuroligin-3). Based on these provocative findings, we hypothesize that peripheral sensory neurons accelerate NF1-deficient Schwann cell growth through the elaboration of mitogens. To identify these potentially clinically-actionable mitogens, we have designed a series of milestone-driven experiments using a novel collection of patient-derived and isogenic human induced pluripotent stem cells harboring NF1-patient germline NF1 gene mutations.",https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn11374345/wiki/488824,Washington University of Saint Louis,Neurofibromatosis 1,Cutaneous Neurofibroma,,,syn11374345,The data from this study is currently under embargo.

Mast cells are known to be abundant in cNFs and they are increasingly more interesting as druggable targets in tumor biology and neurogenic itch. It is also not known whether mast cells of cNFs are tumorigenic or anti- tumorigenic. The goal of this project is to prove that T cells and mast cells are valid targets for the treatment of cNF.

Most plexiform neurofibromas are resistant to chemotherapy and surgical removal is often impossible due to tumor size, location, and nerve integration. We jo not know why some human neurofibromas grow slowly and some rapidly, nor why some neurofibromas respond to therapy but others do not. Plexiform neurofibromas grow most aggressively in young children, and an appealing (unproven) idea is that transiently blocking growth of plexiform neurofibromas early in tumor development will prevent tumor progression. Models to study these critical issues have been lacking. Our laboratory has recently developed mouse models that recapitulate 1) slow and fast growing neurofibromas, and 2) neurofibromas that respond or fail to respond to targeted molecular therapy. We plan to use new methods in gene expression analysis to identify molecular pathways that correlate with these phenotypes in mouse models, with verification on human tissues.

Our studies of JMML specimens proved that NF1 functions as a tumor suppressor gene in hematopoietic cells, and provided the first direct evidence of deregulated Ras signaling in primary cancer cells from NF1 patients. These studies support the role of hyperactive Ras signaling in JMML pathogenesis, and our group and other researchers subsequently discovered mutations in NRAS, KRAS, PTPN11, and CBL in JMML patient specimens.

PNF-derived NF1(+/-) and (-/-) iPS cells have been generated and can be used to test differentiation protocols towards the Neural Crest (NC) -Schwann cell (SC) lineage. Differentiated cells at different points of this lineage commitment can be characterized and engrafted into the sciatic nerve of nude mice to test their tumor-formation capacity and, in this way, interrogate about the identity of the cells originating PNFs. Two things, the setting up the right in vitro iPSC differentiation conditions towards NC and SC in one side and on the other, the characterization of the different steps of differentiation in the NC-SC lineage, will proportionate the basis for performing future drug screenings for PNFs using iPSC-derived cells. The goals of this project are to (1) set up in vitro conditions to efficiently differentiate iPS cells into cells of the Neural Crest -Schwann cell lineage.

There are few therapeutic options, and the vast majority of people with these cancers will die within 5 years of diagnosis. Despite advances in our understanding of the pathobiology of these tumors and the identification of seemingly-promising therapeutic targets using a single mouse MPNST model system (NPCis mice and derivative cell lines), no investigational agents have demonstrated efficacy following translation to human clinical trials. However, there is limited genetic diversity being modeled in these systems, which does not capture the full spectrum of genetic diversity that characterizes human NF1-MPNSTs. In this regard, p53 loss, a common feature of the currently-used preclinical models, is observed in a minority of human MPNSTs. We hypothesize that one of the major reasons that rationally-chosen drugs underperform in human clinical trials is that the preclinical models used to discover and evaluate promising therapeutic agents do not capture the genetic heterogeneity of the human cancer. To optimize clinical translation, we aim to develop a collection of MPNST Patient Derived Xenografts (MPNST-PDXs) for the NF community, which more fully represent the spectrum of genetic heterogeneity seen in the human condition. The main goal of this research project is to develop a set of NF1-MPNST PDX lines that captures the spectrum of molecular heterogeneity of the human disease. The proposal aims to meet the following objectives: a. Create enabling resources including 10 NF1-MPNST PDX lines for preclinical studies. b. Histologically and genomically characterize these 10 NF1-MPNST PDX lines, thereby defining the molecular heterogeneity of these tumors. c.

Recent (unpublished data) demonstrated that small molecule GCPII inhibitors could enhance Schwann cell-mediated myelination both in vitro and in vivo, possibly by inducing non-myelinating Schwann cells to differentiate into a myelinating phenotype. By extension, it was considered conceivable that GCPII inhibition could limit the non-myelinating Schwann cell proliferation that occurs in neurofibromas by inducing the Schwann cells into a differentiated phenotype.

The vast majority of microdeletion patients present themselves with >1000 cutaneous and subcutaneous neurofibromas. They are at increased risk for the development of plexiform neurofibromas (76% vs 43-50%) and have a 4-fold increase in lifetime risk for MPNSTs (up to 50%); tumors also arise at a younger age. As a consequence NF1 microdeletion patients are followed up more rigorously and any complaint of pain or growing tumors is seldom ignored. NF1 microdeletion patients would benefit tremendously from the development of therapies that would prevent the onset MPNSTs and by inference of plexiform neurofibromas. In this patient group the benefits would outweigh the risk of conducting a prevention trial. The goals of this project are to determine if BRD4 inhibitors can prevent or delay the onset of tumors in a mouse model for MPNST development in NF1 microdeletion patients (NPS mice) and if the treatment with BRD4 inhibitors alters the recruitment of immune cells to tumor initiation sites.

These studies identified that direct injection of the AAV product into the sciatic schwannoma lead to the regression of well-established tumors and importantly, prevented new tumors from developing (Prabhaka et al., 2013, Human Gene Therapy). Utilizing a similar concept and in collaboration with Dr. Breakefield, we will test the efficacy of AAV serotypes and its associated control serotype in preventing (as well as reducing) existing tumor volume and number in our Nf1 plexiform neurofibroma mouse model.  Angiogenesis plays a major role in tumor development, growth, and invasion of nearby cells, wherein endoglin is expressed on tumor vessels and is essential for angiogenesis. We hypothesize that inhibition of the endoglin pathway as well as the VEGF pathway in a combinatory therapeutic setting using our Nf1 tumor bearing mouse model will provide signification tumor reduction of plexiform neurofibromas.  Neurofibromas are complex tumors composed of Schwann cells, mast cells, fibroblasts and perineurial cells embedded in collagen that provide a lattice for tumor invasion. Fibroblasts are a major cellular constituent in neurofibromas and are a source of collagen that constitutes ~50% of the dry weight of the tumor. Work performed in our lab has shown that two of the prevalent heterozygous cells found in neurofibromas, mast cells and fibroblasts interact directly to contribute to the tumorigenic phenotype.

Most MPNSTs arise from pre-existing internal plexiform neurofibromas (PNs). The only known effective treatment is complete surgical resection with negative margins but this can be limited by diffuse tumor infiltration into adjacent nerves. A limitation to current methods for detection, using standard MRI sequences, is that they are qualitative in nature, and do not reliably distinguish between benign PNs and MPNSTs. The recognition of pre-malignant tumor foci at a quantitative level before development of a clinical MPNST would be highly coveted to enable early intervention. Radiomics is a high-throughput computational method that extracts quantitative features from MRI, such as tumor volume, intensity, shape, and texture. It is hypothesized that radiomic features that will allow for differentiation between benign and malignant tumors can be identified from the analysis of a large database of MPNST and PN image files with paired clinical data, from which a predictive model can be built and validated in a prospective fashion. For this approach, MRI scans and clinical data from 200 NF1 patients will be collected from eight participating sites, including data on previously described risk factors of MPNST. Following review of the provided images to determine which are of sufficient quality for inclusion, a training set (N = 60 in each MPNST and PN group) and validation set (N = 20 in each MPNST and PN group) of 160 patients total will be assembled. Radiomics analysis will be utilized to identify MRI features that differentiate between benign and malignant tumors. The ability of the identified radiomic features (from the training/validation phase) to predict malignant transformation will then be evaluated in an independent test set of 40 patients (N = 20 MPNST, N = 20 PN).

Problems with working memory (WM) are particularly relevant for day-to-day functioning since they are important listening and following instructions, reasoning and making decisions. The aim of this study is to understand the brain mechanisms underlying WM difficulties in NF1 and discover new treatments that might be used to help. This study will investigate how the brain chemical GABA as assessed with Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) relates to WM difficulties in NF1 as assessed by cognitive studies and correlated with functional MRI measures such as blood-oxygen level-dependent (BOLD). I hypothesize that GABA concentration is related to WM performance on cognitive studies. Using a mechanistic experimental trial, transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) will be used to modulate GABA. We will then study the relationship between baseline GABA levels and WM and levels of GABA after tDCS and its relationahip to WM as assessed both BOLD signal on MRI and WM performance metrics. The clinical study will be conducted in a cohort of 30 adolescents aged 11-17 years (randomized, crossover design) with NF1, applying real or sham tDCS to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). The 30 patients enrolled in the study will visit clinic two times, for a total of 60 patient visits. State-of-art real time imaging techniques such as MRS and task based functional MRI (fMRI) will be used to investigate the effect of tDCS on GABA concentration, changes in functional plasticity, and working memory. Exploration of the structural imaging markers that might relate with WM metrics will also be investigated. NF1 focused research will be conducted 3 days a week. It is anticipated that findings from this study will not only help elucidate the neural underpinnings of WM deficits in people with NF1 but, also provide the biologic and functional evidence to support tDCS a novel, low-cost intervention that can be to improve WM in people with NF1.",https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn17100988/wiki/587928,University of Manchester,Neurofibromatosis 1,,,,syn17100988,,,"syn4939894, syn5698493"

205,99,Exploring Nonsense Suppression as a Treatment for NF1,syn21641813,syn21666953,Active,None,David Bedwell,GFF,"Nonsense mutations comprise around 20% of NF1 mutations. Nonsense mutations are gene lesions that introduce a premature termination codon (PTC) into a messenger RNA (mRNA). A PTC reduces protein expression through two mechanisms. First, a PTC prematurely terminates translation of an mRNA, which prevents the formation of a full-length, functional protein. Second, a PTC can trigger the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway, which degrades the mRNA and prevents it from undergoing translation. Together, these two PTC-mediated mechanisms can severely reduce neurofibromin protein expression and function. Since PTCs are found in a significant number of NF1 patients, we propose to identify therapies that suppress the effects of PTCs to restore neurofibromin protein expression and function. Work previously funded by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CFF) developed and characterized reporters that can detect compounds capable of suppressing termination at PTCs and/or inhibiting nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) of PTC-containing mRNAs. A total of 771,345 small molecules were screened and 157 compounds were confirmed as hits. The project proposed here would examine whether this collection of new, validated, PTC suppression agents restore full-length neurofibromin protein and its function in NF1 cell and animal models that carry nonsense mutations.

Gene therapy has seen tremendous advances in recent years in the delivery of genes to select tissues to compensate for mutations that cause genetic disease. However, there are two primary challenges that prevent extending these developments to NF1. First, there is currently no method to deliver genes to the cells that initiate tumor development. Second, the NF1 gene is particularly large and is not accommodated within the size-restricted viruses currently used for gene therapy. A team was assembled with the unique and complementary expertise to overcome both of these challenges and apply the resulting technology to clinically relevant animal models of NF1. First, an innovative strategy will be used to engineer new viruses that target the tumor initiating cells of the peripheral nervous system. Second, CRISPR-based genome editing will be used to restore the mutated NF1 gene, thereby circumventing the need to deliver a copy of the full-length NF1 gene sequence. Finally, the ability of these engineered viruses and genome editing strategies to reduce tumor burden in a mouse model of NF1 will be tested. Each of these approaches have been successfully applied in the context of other disease areas, and through this project this success will be extended to address the challenges of developing a gene therapy for NF1. This work will also involve several technological advances that will be generally useful to the field and complement other strategies being explored to apply gene therapy and genome editing to NF1.

Although nonsense codons are normally an integral part of the flow of information from DNA to RNA to protein, they also arise in random places within genes because of a specific type of mutation known as a nonsense mutation. Such mutations halt the process of protein synthesis prematurely and thus inactivate the function of genes and cause genetic disorders. Nonsense mutations comprise ~20% of the disease-causing mutations in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). The drug, ataluren, can suppress protein synthesis termination at premature nonsense codons and produce limited but functionally significant quantities of essential proteins in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and in mouse and tissue culture models of multiple diseases. In the experiments of this proposal mouse cells will be grown and live mice whose NF1 genes harbor nonsense mutations and test whether ataluren can restore the synthesis and function of the NF1 protein in these cells and animals.

The proposal establishes a new collaborative team that brings together the expertise of two laboratories, each of which has established critical technologies and reagents on hand that provides a new approach for treating NF1. The Kesterson lab (UAB) has established several critical reagents for the study of NF1 including a newly created system to study NF1 by having a full-length NF1 cDNA that represents the key ""coding"" regions of the NF1 gene, which has all the critical information needed to produce the entire neurofibromin protein. His laboratory has also created the first mice and rats that have mutations in their NF1 gene that completely mimic those seen in patients. The Zhou lab (Yale) has developed key technologies based on ""nanoparticles"" for delivery of large size DNA like NF1, or for gene-editing reagents known as CRISPR/Cas9 that can correct mutations at the DNA level. This project proposes to conduct needed pre-clinical studies in NF1 relevant animal models to assess the ability to use nanoparticles to 1) deliver the cDNA that will then make neurofibromin protein, and 2) deliver the gene-editing reagents to directly correct the mutation causing NF1. Rats will also be created that carry NF1 patient mutations and characterize those for tumor formation and cognitive deficits. Rats are well known in the neuroscience field as the preferred species to assess cognitive and behavioral function.

Cech and Sydney Altman for their discovery of ribonucleic acid (RNA) molecules with catalytic properties similar to those of protein enzymes, leading to the term 'ribozymes'. Cech and colleagues studied a specific ribozyme, an intron of a gene in Tetrahymena thermophila, a single-celled organism. Ribozymes of its kind can be modified to specifically bind to a target RNA of choice, split this RNA at a specific site into two parts, and replace one part with another RNA sequence that is attached to the ribozyme. This so-called trans-splicing ability of engineered ribozymes establishes a potential strategy for therapeutic RNA repair: The faulty part of RNA that resulted from a genetic mutation in its associated gene is removed and replaced by the correct part. Such a repaired transcript then translates into fully functional proteins. Early proofs of this concept demonstrated repair of defective RNAs involved in cancer (p53), myotonic muscular dystrophy (DMPK) and sickle-cell anemia (beta-globin). This proposal builds upon this concept: Bioengineered trans-acting ribozymes are used to target faulty transcripts of the NF1 gene that carry mutations causing neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). The aim is to effectively and specifically restore function to the NF1 gene product for a variety of patient-derived NF1 mutations in human cell lines. As part of the ribozyme design, potential obstacles on the path to NF1 clinical application will be considered and analyzed, including delivery of the therapeutic ribozymes, avoidance of off-target effects, and minimization of a possible immune response. By developing NF1 mouse models with patient specific mutations that are amenable to ribozyme-mediated correction we will prepare for subsequent animal studies, a necessary step prior to clinical testing.

NF1 patients initially have one of the two NF1 alleles which remains normal but is prone to become inactivated. When this occurs, benign tumors called neurofibromas develop and cause various health complications. In some cases, neurofibromas transform into aggressive life-threatening tumors. Initial identification of the NF1 gene as causative for the disease created hope that the defect could be corrected using gene therapy strategies. However, genetic correction of NF1 mutations is met with several outstanding issues that render this type of approach unlikely to succeed for the time being. Instead of trying to correct the disease causing-mutation, this project proposes a new approach to treat NF1 that aims at killing cells that have inactivated both copies of the NF1 gene. The concept underlying this original therapeutic approach is based on the fact that mutation of one gene often creates vulnerabilities towards inactivation of other genes that are not normally required for cell survival. A spinoff of the recently developed CRISPR/CAS9 technology will be used to identify genes that become essential for the survival of cells that have inactivated both copies of the NF1 gene.

There is a type of drug called a ""nonsense mutation suppressor"" that restores full-length production of protein in genes that have these mutations. These drugs are being developed for diseases like Cystic Fibrosis and Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, and many clinical trials are underway for these patients. Unfortunately, the immense impact these drugs could have on NF1 patients with these mutations has yet to be explored. The goal of this proposal is to investigate the potential of nonsense mutation suppression therapies in NF1 patients. This group has developed a minipig model of NF1 that shows many of the clinical signs seen in human patients of NF1, including cafe-au-lait spots, dermal neurofibromas, and optic pathway glioma, and it has been used to find drugs that are both safe and effective in our preclinical model that can better inform researchers and clinicians before these drugs go into clinical trials in NF1 patients. Here, this project aims to develop a new swine model of NF1 with a slightly different mutation that will be suitable for testing these nonsense mutation suppression therapies. The preclinical utility of these drugs will be established with the goal of initiating a clinical trial in NF1 patients with a drug that is safe, tolerable, and effective in restoring NF1 gene function.

Newer, less toxic therapies are needed. Antisense directed gene therapy, and more specifically exon skipping, is a successful therapeutic strategy for other diseases including Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) which also affects children. Antisense directed gene therapy causes cells to ""skip"" over faulty pieces of the genetic code, leading to a truncated but still functional protein despite the genetic mutation. Antisense oligonucleotides (AONs) are short synthetic modified nucleic acids that bind RNA through base pairing and enable modulation of its expression. The project hypothesizes that antisense directed gene therapy can be utilized to treat NF1 and is designed to test that possibility. Exons, the coding part of genes, within the NF1 transcript that may be skipped and still maintain gene function must be identified. The first aim is to create copies of the NF1 gene that are missing these prioritized exons and test their function in cell-based molecular assays. Next, antisense oligonucleotides will be designed and tested. This will involve computer-aided sequence analysis of the NF1 genomic region and the design of NF1 antisense phosphonodiamidite morpholino oligomers (PMOs) that target specific exons. These PMOs will be tested in normal cells for their exon-skipping efficiency. Human cell lines that have deleterious, patient-specific NF1 mutations will also be created using CRISPR/Cas9 technology to edit the genome. These mutations will occur within exons that have been shown to maintain gene function after deletion. PMOs that are efficacious will be moved forward and be tested in dose response for exon skipping efficiency in cells containing patient mutations. NF1 function will also be evaluated. Finally, mice models will be created, and the phenotypes characterized such that they may be used to show proof-of-Principal that exon skipping could be therapeutic for NF1. Ideally, exon skipping could be used clinically to treat NF1 patients that harbor mutations in non-critical regions of the gene. Production of even partially functional NF1 could help ameliorate phenotypes. This project will make the following three contributions to advancing the field of NF research. First, we will determine if exon skipping strategies are even a possibility for treating NF1. Second, data generated will direct future structure-function studies and possibly help lead to a ""mini-NF1"" gene cassette for gene replacement therapies.

Retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), the nerve cells that send visual information from the eye to the brain, are vulnerable to the effects of aberrant astrocytes and microglia, and undergo cell death in many patients with OPGs, resulting in an irretrievable loss of vision. The objectives of this research are to prevent RGCs from dying in cases in which NF1-associated OPGs are diagnosed at an early stage of progression, or to enable remaining RGCs to regenerate connections back to the brain in cases in which OPGs are diagnosed at a more advanced stage and axons have atrophied. Several treatments that have proven to be successful in preserving injured RGCs and/or enabling RGCs to regenerate dam-age nerve fibers in earlier studies from our lab and others will first be tested individually for beneficial or possible negative effects in a mouse model of NF1-associated OPG. Therapies that prove to be benign or beneficial will then be combined and tested in larger groups in early and later stages of OPG progression in mice. In more basic research, we will investigate how 3 newly discovered pathways that regulate RGC survival interact with each other to develop better treatments for OPGs.

Thus, it is absolutely crucial to gain thorough understanding of these features in animal models of NF1 in order to develop viable strategies for curing vision loss in NF1 patients. This proposal outlines a strategy to define the optic eye-to-brain pathway in NF1 mutant mice and the specific structural and molecular barriers that must be overcome in order for optic axon regeneration to occur at different stages of the disease. We will test the efficacy of enhancing retinal neural activity on regeneration in NF1 mutants, and the impact of increasing specific cell growth pathways alone or in combination with activity augmentation. Using state-of-the-art tools, we propose to assess retinal axon regeneration, tumor growth and stability and recovery of visual function. Successful completion of these studies should greatly inform our understanding of visual defects in NF1 and strategies to reverse and overcome them.",https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn21650464/wiki/601469,Stanford University School of Medicine,Neurofibromatosis 1,,,,,,,"syn4939914, syn21650395"
219,99,Generation and neuroprotective studies of NF1 patient-derived RGCs,syn21650476,syn21669909,Active,None,Donald Zack,GFF,"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is the most common genetic condition in which individuals carrying the mutation are predisposed to develop a variety of types of tumors. Approximately 20% of children with NF1 mutations will develop tumors of the nerve that carries visual information from the eye to the brain, so called optic pathway gliomas (OPGs). NF1 OPGs can cause permanent vision loss ranging from a mild decline in visual acuity to complete blindness. Up to 50% of children with NF1 OPGs will suffer vision loss, typically between 1 to 8 years of age, which has a significant lifelong impact on the child's overall health and quality of life. Enhancing and restoring visual function in children with NF1 OPGs could dramatically improve their lifelong quality of life.Vision loss from NF1 OPGs ultimately results from damage to and loss of the retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), the retinal neurons that carry visual information from the eye to the brain. Since mammalian RGCs do not regenerate, it is important to develop approaches that maintain the health of a patient's remaining RGCs, so as to reduce or prevent additional vision loss. It is the goal of our work, which is part of the Gilbert Vision Restoration Initiative (GVRI), to use RGCs derived from human stem cells to better understand how NF1 mutations lead to RGC damage and cell loss and to develop strategies to promote RGC survival and function. NF1 RGCs will be generated from small skin biopsy or blood samples from patients with NF1 mutations. These patient derived cells will then be studied in our and other labs lab to uncover how their mutations affect the RGCs, and then we will test thousands of small molecules to try to identify ones that can reverse the effect of the NF1 mutation. It is hoped that these studies will lead to the development of potential drugs to preserve the vision of patients suffering from Neurofibromatosis type 1.",https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn21650476/wiki/601471,Johns Hopkins University,Neurofibromatosis 1,,,,,,,syn21650488
220,99,RGC differentiation and transplantation for NF1 OPG,syn21650480,syn21669921,Active,None,Jeffrey Goldberg,GFF,"What regulates neuronal growth and differentiation in the central nervous system (CNS)? The optic neuropathy and vision loss seen in optic glioma (OPG) in some cases associated with Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is one such disease that afflicts the eye that leads to damage and eventual loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). Once lost, RGCs are not replaced in humans or other mammals resulting in irreversible blindness. Transplantation of stem cell derived-RGCs could be a feasible approach to restore vision; however, little is known about how to promote RGC differentiation from stem cells (SCs), or whether stem cell derived-RGCs transplanted into an adult would be able to integrate into either intact or degenerating retinal circuits, particularly in the context of an NF1 patient's retina. Thus, identifying the relevant signaling pathways that promote RGC specification will be necessary to generate donor RGCs that integrate and form functional connections within recipient retinas.Stem cell-based approaches provide new hope for the treatment of many neurodegenerative diseases. To date, several protocols have been reported for RGC generation from hiPSCs and hESCs, however these protocols are labor intensive, require significant time in culture, and yield only a few RGCs. To overcome these issues, we propose to utilize a rapid and direct induced RGC (iRGC) protocol modified from an induced neuron (iN) protocol established in an adjacent Stanford lab to investigate GDF, SoxC and other signaling on RGC fate specification in hiPSCs, with and without the NF1 background. The ultimate goal of this project will be to improve the efficiency of RGC differentiation from hiPSCs, and demonstrate efficacy of iRGC transplant with anatomic and functional assays, with attention to NF1 mutation in the donor iRGC population, and in the recipient host mouse.",https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn21650480/wiki/601472,Stanford University School of Medicine,Neurofibromatosis 1,,,,,,,syn21650484
221,99,Stem cell derived RGCs: Improving the success of transplantation strategies,syn21650484,syn21669929,Active,None,Michael Young,GFF,"Our overall goal is to improve the success of RGC transplantation, using mouse cells, together with tissue engineering and pig to pig transplantation studies. We will first identify and optimize key variables using mouse cells that can be applied for pig, non-human primate and human retinal ganglion cell precursors. The premise is that the development of RGCs from stem cells is conserved and the cues we identify may be relevant for all RGCs. Testing them in mouse has two key advantages: The timeframe for differentiation is much shorter, which allows one to test more variables; and the mouse model allows for mouse to mouse (allograft) studies which is a likely therapeutic strategy in humans. We have shown that mouse stem cells-derived RGCs are diverse, functional and integrate into healthy and RGC-depleted retinas following injection into the chamber of the eye in front of the retina. We have also demonstrated long-term survival and growth of processes into the optic nerve. We have three sub-aims for this approach: 1 ) Identifying the stage of differentiation with the highest potential for transplantation 2. Evaluate different types of RGCs for transplantation studies 3. Improving RGC maturation in retinal tissue, differentiated from stem cells. We will work closely with team members to develop appropriate differentiation (DZ) and transplantation (JG) protocols.We will also develop novel tissue engineered transplants aimed at improving graft success. Using cells and protocols from Aim 1, we will develop polymer composite grafts capable of improving survival, engraftment, and differentiation of transplanted RGCs. Cells from JG and DZ, along with cells from Aim 1 will be used for these studies. Lastly, building upon studies by team members using mouse and human RGCs, we will develop pig RGCs for the purpose of performing pig-pig allograft (same species) studies in disease models. Human and mouse protocols from DZ and PB will be used to generate pig RGCs.",https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn21650484/wiki/601473,Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary,Neurofibromatosis 1,,,,,,,syn21650480

Since mammalian RGCs do not regenerate, for those patients who have already suffered significant RGC cell death and associated vision loss, the Gilbert Vision Restoration Initiative (GVRI) is pursuing the development of technology to replace a patient's lost RGCs with human stem cell derived RGCs. We have already developed methodology to generate RGCs from stem cells generated from a small skin biopsy or blood sample. As part of the GVRI, we will optimize this methodology and better characterize the resulting RGCs at the single cell level. We will also perform screens to identify molecules and genes that can help the new RGCs, after transplantation into the eye, find their targets in the brain. Although there is still a long road ahead, based on exciting recent work in the field, there is now real hope that the Exogenous RGC Replacement work being sponsored by the GVRI will, in the years ahead, help lead the way to restoring vision to those suffering from NF1 OPGs and other forms of optic nerve disease.",https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn21650488/wiki/601474,Johns Hopkins University,Neurofibromatosis 1,,,,,,,syn21650476
223,99,Retina regeneration in zebrafish-Endogenous RGC replacement,syn21650493,syn21670947,Active,None,Daniel Goldman,GFF,"NF1 is a disease resulting from reduced levels of neurofibromin 1 that functions as a tumor suppressor. One in five children with NF1 have optic nerve tumors that can lead to retinal ganglion cell death and blindness. One approach for treating NF1-related blindness is to regenerate retinal ganglion cells from endogenous stem cells. Because zebrafish use endogenous stem cells to regenerate retinal ganglion cells, we propose that understanding this process in fish will inform us of strategies for stimulating a similar process in humans. With this goal in mind, we aim to identify gene expression changes and small molecules that are sufficient to drive retina regeneration in zebrafish and test their effect on retina regeneration in mammals.",https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn21650493/wiki/601475,University of Michigan,Neurofibromatosis 1,,,,,,,syn21650499
224,99,Factors that promote ganglion cell regeneration,syn21650499,syn21670978,Active,None,Thomas Reh,GFF,"Currently, there are no effective therapies to replace degenerated neurons in patients with retinal ganglion cell loss from optic pathway glioma (OPG), such as occurs in patients with Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). By contrast, retinas of non-mammalian vertebrates, such as fish and amphibians, show a robust regenerative response following retinal damage. Upon injury to the retina, fish Muller Glia generate all different types of retinal neurons to replace those that were lost. There has been considerable progress in understanding the molecular mechanisms of regeneration in non-mammalian vertebrates, and if this knowledge could be applied to humans, it might lead to the development of new types of regenerative therapies for patients with impaired vision from Neurofibromatosis type 1. We have recently found that by expressing a key regulatory gene called Ascl1 in the Muller glia of mice, we can induce them to regenerate new neurons after injury to the ganglion cells. The new regenerated neurons in the mouse retinas wired up with the existing, undamaged neurons and became functional. These results showed for the first time that functional neuron regeneration is possible in mammals, like ourselves. We would like to apply these findings to patients; unfortunately not all types of retinal neurons were regenerated in the mouse retina, and one of the types of neurons that they do not regenerate is the ganglion cell, precisely the cell type lost in NF1 patients. Therefore, we propose to figure out what is missing that would allow the Muller glia of mice to make new ganglion cells, by developing novel screening methods to identify these factors. This proposal outlines a series of pilot experiments that will help ensure that the factors we identify in these screens are particularly relevant for NF1 patients.",https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn21650499/wiki/601476,University of Washington,Neurofibromatosis 1,,,,,,,syn21650493
